# Tim-Berners-Lee

I didn't know that **Tim Berners-Lee** was the inventor of `HTML`,the cause to all my current fun and problems as a web developer. In his honor, I make this [webpage](https://mika215.github.io/Tim-Berners-Lee/).Indeed the webpage that you are going to see [here](https://mika215.github.io/Tim-Berners-Lee/) was not originaly designed by me.Rather it was a predfined mockup given by my coaches at the [becode](https://becode.org/).
